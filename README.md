# ðŸ“š PyTorch AI/ML/Transformers Tome 

This repository showcases best practices and experiments using PyTorch to implement transformers (e.g., plain, ViTs, and other network architectures) and related areas. The code is self-contained, solving specific problems while allowing researchers to adapt and apply best practices efficiently. It emphasizes efficiency, readability, and minimal comments to support quick updates. 

Recommended for intermediate to advanced researchers, as time complexity in algorithms is also considered. Beginners are encouraged to explore other materials available online. Over time, this repository will expand to cover various AI topics, including classification, prediction, recommendations, and generative AI.

## Setup Environment
Run the `./goenv.sh` script:

```
source ./goenv.sh
```
On the first run, it will set up a virtual environment, install all required libraries, and activate it automatically.
